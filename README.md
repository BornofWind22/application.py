# application.py
Basketball Stats Tool

This application is intended to satisfying the grade of meets expectations for the python tech degree project 2. I have made not adjusted the initial CONSTANTS.py file and have created a file that containst the functions necessary to generate a simply basketball team statistics tool. Along the process I had difficulty in figuring out a few different steps but after working with individuals on the Slack channel I believe I have a project that is sufficient in moving forward. 

I look forward to receiving feedback on my project and continuing my journey within the Python community.
